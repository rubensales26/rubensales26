# About me
Matematician *in the making* that applies theoretical knowledge to real-world problems. My background combines the depth of pure subjects with a practical coding experience acquired through my degree and my internships.

## 🔭 Current Focus
- **Thesis:** Writing my thesis in **Combinatorial Optimization**, particularly studying *The periodic vehicle routing problem with driver consistency*. Comparing different methods and heuristics for solving this problem and investigating the use of **Neural Networks** in the computation of optimality bounds.
- **Internship:** Implementing **Finite Differences** and **Finite Elements** to solve systems of ODEs that model nuclear reactor dynamics.

## 🛠️ Technical Toolkit
- **Languages:** *Python* (*Pydantic, openai*), *R*, *MATLAB*, *SQL*, *LaTeX*
- **Mathematical Tools:** *Wolfram Mathematica* (basic knowledge), *Excel* (for linear programming)
- **AI/ML:** OpenAI API, Prompt Engineering, Document Processing
- **Theoretical Math:** Linear Algebra, Calculus, Linear Programming, Heuristics, ODEs/PDEs, Numerical Analysis

## 💬 Ask me about...
- **How to process documents using LLMS:** My experience tuning this technology for extracting and processing information correctly from real invoices.
- **How to apply heuristics to problems:** Applying **GRASP** and **Path Relinking** methodologies to solve Combinatorial Optimization problems.
- **How to implement numerical algorithms:** Turning complex math into algorithms that work.

## 🇳🇴 Seeking Opportunities
I will be in **Kristiansand, Norway** in April 2026 for the **GeoAI Week**. I am actively seeking a Summer 2026 Internship in Norway where I can continue developing myself and my career by facing AI, Geodata, or Engineering challenges.

## ⚡ Fun Facts
- I started studying Data Science but switched to Mathematics because I wanted to understand the *why* behind algorithms, not just the *how*.
- Cooking is my passion and I see math the same way. In order to cook something excellent, you need to fail many times and put in a lot of time and effort.
- I am very much interested in philosophy, arts and languages. I am currently learning German.
